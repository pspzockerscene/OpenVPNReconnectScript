# OpenVPNReconnectScript

Batch script which uses OpenVPN to change the current IP.
Ready to use in downloadmanagers such as JDownloader.

Setup instructions:
1. Adjust your OpenVPN install dir if needed where ``openvpndir=C:\...`` is.  
2. If you are planning to always run this script as admin, you may as well just move it into your OpenVPN install dir right where ``openvpn.exe`` is located.
3. Doubleclick on the script to run it manually once in order to see if it works.
4. Use it in other tools e.g. in JDownloader.
